## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).



Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
